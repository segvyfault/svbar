# svbar
memory efficient usage bar written for myself  
wrote this because fuck waybar/eww/quickshell for using 500mb of ram

# Important
- I didn't write this bar for public use and pushed it to github just to not lose the src
- If you complain "oh how do i add tray icons" ill say no and close issue/pr whatever
- Feel free to fork and do whatever you want with this
